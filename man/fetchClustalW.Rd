\arguments{
\item{inputSeqs}{The sequences the user would like to align. Can either
be an alignment ID of a Balibase alignment or a file path to a .mfa file
containing sequences for an alignment.}

\item{readType}{The type of characters found in the provided input
sequences. Can either be "AA", "DNA" or "RNA" depending on the characters
in the file.

For the remaining parameters:
Please view details on msa::msa() function which provides details about the
remaining parameters for writeMuscle}
}
\value{
The alignment generated by ClustalW in the form of a seqinr
alignment.
}
\description{
\code{<function>} Return a seqinr alignment containing sequences that are
aligned by the ClustalW alignment algorithm. The user may search the
referenceDB for a set of BaliBASE sequences by entering the alignment ID
as input, or they may input a .mfa file containing the sequences in
fasta format.
